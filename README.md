This is a keyboard/device store website for my coursework ✍️. I wanted to try Next.js. The website clears my MVP requirements for this project, but there are some things to work on 🗒:

- All images are stored locally, for Vercel some persistent storage provider should be used
- Add search
- Add missing category pages
- Expand admin panel functionality
- Refactor code
- Enhance UI
- Add fullscreen image viewing to product page
- Add payment system
- Display whether product is currently out of stock in cart
- etc.
